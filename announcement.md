Happy Holidays as the year wraps closer to the end. We want to thank you for standing by while we had some issues. Now with that said the site VVV below is a very much WIP. We are looking for developers to help us please reach out at our email <a href="mailto:owner@joncodingreviews.com">owner@joncodingreviews.com</a>. Now with all that said our bot is still a work in progress and still working out kinks with the work stress and other things going on we have put the Bot's Devolpement on the back burner. We know this is a long message but we appericate your time.
